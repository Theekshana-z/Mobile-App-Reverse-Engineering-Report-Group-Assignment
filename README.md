# Mobile App Reverse Engineering Report – Group Assignment

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains our group's submission for the **3rd Year, 1st Semester** project for the **Information Management Systems (IMS)** module at SLIIT. The project focuses on analyzing and reverse-engineering a mobile application to identify potential security vulnerabilities and understand its underlying architecture.

## 🧩 Project Structure

The repository includes the following file:

* `MS Assignment.pdf`: A comprehensive report detailing the reverse engineering process, findings, and recommendations.

## 🔐 About Mobile App Reverse Engineering

Mobile app reverse engineering involves deconstructing and analyzing the components of a mobile application to understand its functionality, identify potential security flaws, and assess its overall design. This process is crucial for:

* **Security Analysis**: Identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.
* **Understanding App Behavior**: Gaining insights into how the app interacts with the system and other applications.
* **Compliance and Auditing**: Ensuring the app adheres to relevant standards and regulations.

## 🛠️ Tools and Techniques Used

To reverse-engineer the mobile application, we employed various tools and techniques, including:

* **APKTool**: For disassembling and rebuilding APK files.
* **JADX**: For decompiling DEX files into Java source code.
* **Frida**: For dynamic instrumentation and analysis of runtime behavior.
* **Burp Suite**: For intercepting and analyzing network traffic.
* **Android Studio**: For debugging and analyzing the app's source code.

## 📄 Documentation

The `MS Assignment.pdf` file provides a detailed analysis of:

* **Reverse Engineering Methodology**: Step-by-step process followed during the reverse engineering.
* **Findings**: Identified security vulnerabilities and potential risks.
* **Recommendations**: Suggested improvements and mitigations to enhance app security.
